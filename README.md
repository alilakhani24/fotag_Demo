# fotag_Demo

This is a demo video of my fotag project. The code can be shared upon request

App platform
Ali Lakhani 20671281 a25lakha openjdk version "12.0.2" macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra (MacBook Pro 2018) 
This app was made on IntelliJ using Java

Objective
This application is a photo rating application. Users can upload their images - which will be saved upon exiting the application. All images can be deleted upon clicking the reset button. As a whole users can rate their images and filter by stars. When 2 stars are selected in the menu bar above, all images with at least a 2 star rating will be displayed. Moreover, the window is dynamic and so will adjust the number of displayed images per column based on the variable size of the window. Clicking on an image will enlargen it for viewing. Enjoy!
